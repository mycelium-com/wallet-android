Beta channel
============
In order to receive updates quicker than others, you need to do two things:

to be eligible for testing you need to join the g+ group at

https://plus.google.com/communities/102264813364583686576

after joining, you need to explicitly enable beta versions for the software at

https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.mycelium.wallet

As Beta Testers, please make sure you have a recent **backup of the masterseed** and all the **private keys** inside Mycelium. Beta testers will experience a lot of the bugs that are introduced. So far this was never necessary but we don't explicitly give this guarantee.

Building
========

To build everything from source, simply checkout the source and build using gradle
on the build system you need

 * JDK 1.7

Then you need to use the Android SDK manager to install the following components:

 * ANDROID_HOME environment variable pointing to the directory where the sdk is installed
 * Android SDK Tools 22.6.4
 * SDK Platform Tools 19.0.2
 * Android SDK build Tools 19.1.0
 * Android 4.4.2 (API 19) (at least SDK Platform Rev. 3)
 * Android Extras:
    * Android Support Repository rev 5
    * Android Support Library rev 19.1
    * Google Play services for Froyo rev 12
    * Google Play services rev 17
    * Google Repository rev 8


The project layout is designed to be used with a recent version of Android Studio (currently 1.1.0)

On the console write

    git clone https://github.com/mycelium-com/wallet.git
    cd wallet

Linux/mac

    ./gradlew build

Windows: 

    gradlew.bat build

 - voilà, look into wallet/public/mbw/build/apk to see the generated apk. 
   there are versions for prodnet and testnet.

alternatively you can install the latest version from the Play store at

https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mycelium.wallet

If you cannot access the Play store you can obtain the apk directly from https://mycelium.com/bitcoinwallet
